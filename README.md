# Zillow + PHP Example

This is a simple example of using the Zillow web service API with PHP and AJAX.  Other stuff used: Google Maps API (for autocomplete), Bootstrap (with a Bootswatch theme) to show results, and jQuery BlockUI.  

The primary/good stuff is in the Zillow.class.php file, if you are looking for a starting point how to connect to the Zillow web service API and start getting info back right away, check there.

Everything you need (jQuery, Bootstrap, BlockUI, etc) comes with it, you just need a Google Maps API key and a Zillow Web Service API Key, see below for where to put them
