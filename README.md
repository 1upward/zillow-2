# Zillow + PHP Example

This is a simple example of using the Zillow web service API with PHP and some jQuery/JS for Google Maps using Bootstrap (with a Bootswatch theme) to show results.  Simple and maybe a building block to get you started, feel free to contribute to improving it's capabilities.  pardamike@gmail.com
